# ryz' dotfiles #

These are (some of) my personal config files for *NIX systems, tailored to my likes and needs.

## Environment ##

I am currently using these files mainly on MAC OS X and Arch Linux. I prefer to use zsh (Z shell) and highly encourage you to use this great Unix shell!

## Features ##

My (g)Vim configuration is included via the git submodule found here: [https://github.com/ryz/vim-ryz](https://github.com/ryz/vim-ryz).

There are several other features that i'll explain in detail at a later time.
